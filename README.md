# Introduction

About you:

* You're curious about rOpenSci's review process.
* You may want to author, review, or edit an R package for rOpenSci.

About me:

* I build tools to help researchers get the most out of their data.
* Before I was a biologist.
* I joined rOpenSci in 2018 and played different roles.

## How can this talk help you?

The whole process is complex and can feel overwhelming. This talk helps by:

   * highlighting the most important stuff.
   * showing you where you can find the rest.

# The most important stuff

[The software-review repo](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review):

* [Why do we review software?](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review?tab=readme-ov-file#why-and-how-submit-your-package-to-ropensci)
* [How do we communicate?](https://ropensci.org/code-of-conduct/)
* [How do we build and review software?](https://devguide.ropensci.org/)

> [Helping to improve software] in a kind and respectful way is just as
important as the technical aspect -- Yani

## Be kind and respectful

* View everyone's contribution as a kind act that they did to you and others.
* Be kind and respectful (contributions are free but  costly).

> It's like when I hold the door open for someone. (...) Criticizing how I held the
door open ... leads to people no longer being willing to hold open doors for
others.
