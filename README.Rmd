# Introduction

## About you and us

About you:

-   You're curious about rOpenSci's review process.
-   You may want to author, review, or edit an R package for rOpenSci.

## About you and us

About us:

*Mauro:*

-   I build tools to support research in green finance.
-   Before I was a biologist.
-   I joined rOpenSci in 2018 and played different roles.

*Noam:*

-   I am a disease ecologist that works with modeling and field teams
-   I've worked with rOpenSci since 2014, primarily doing peer-review editorial work
-   I've been Executive Director for \< 3 weeks!

## [Why peer-review?](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review?tab=readme-ov-file#why-and-how-submit-your-package-to-ropensci)

-   Drive adoption of best practices and standards
-   Increase quality in the long tail of applications
-   Build a community of practice

## Drive adoption of best practices and standards

_Some quotes from authors and reviewers:_

> "The review process taught me a lot about different tools available for making my code more robust and resilient to future changes."

> "I learn a lot from closely reading other people's code and it is hard to do when I'm not forced to review so closely."

> "I really love the rOpenSci pacakage review process, especially its interactivity and how much you can learn from others."

## Increase quality in the long tail of applications

## This was something of an accident!

rOpenSci evolved from 

 - A group of people who wrote R packages, to
 - A group of people who manageed a lot of R packages, and realized we needed review, to
 - A group of people who reviewed R packages, and realized we needed a process, to
 - A group of people managed a review process, and realized ***we needed a community.***

## Why this talk? \| The process is complex and can feel overwhelming

The process is complex and can feel overwhelming.

This talk:

-   Highlights the most important materials.
-   Shows you where you can find the rest.
-   Gives you the chance to ask questions.

# Two crucial components

* The way we communicate: [Code of conduct](https://ropensci.org/code-of-conduct/).
* The way we build and review software: ["Devguide"](https://devguide.ropensci.org/).

## Be kind and respectful
