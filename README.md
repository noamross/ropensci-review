# Introduction

## Who are you?

* An actual or potential community member, package author, reviewer or editor.
* Someone who might want to try our process elsewhere.

## Who am I?

I build tools to help researchers get the most out of their data.

Before I was a biologist.

My roles at rOpenSci: runconf participant, rejected author, co-author, reviewer,
guest editor, editor, editor in chief, mentor.

## How can this talk help you?

The whole process is complex and can feel overwhelming. 

Here we will:

* Highlight what's most important.
* Show you where you can find the rest.

# The most important stuff

[rOpenSci's software-review repo](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review) links to our: 

* [Code of conduct](https://ropensci.org/code-of-conduct/): The way we communicate.
* ["devguide"](https://devguide.ropensci.org/): The way we build and review software.

## The way we communicate: Why is it so important?

> [Helping to improve software] in a kind and respectful way is just as
important as the technical aspect -- Yani

What do you think?

## View every contribution as kindness to you and others

> It's like when I hold the door open for someone. (...) Criticizing how I held the
door open ... leads to people no longer being willing to hold open doors for
others.
