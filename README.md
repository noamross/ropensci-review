# Introduction

## Who are you and me?


About you:

* You're curious about rOpenSci's review process.
* You may want to author, review, or edit an R package for rOpenSci.

About me:

* I build tools to help researchers get the most out of their data.
* Before I was a biologist.
* I joined rOpenSci in 2018 and played different roles.

## Why this process and why talk?

* [Why do we review software?](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review?tab=readme-ov-file#why-and-how-submit-your-package-to-ropensci)

* The whole process is complex and can feel overwhelming. This talk helps by:

   * highlighting the most important stuff.
   * showing you where you can find the rest.

# Two crucial components

## Two crucial components

* [The way we communicate](https://ropensci.org/code-of-conduct/)
* [The way we build and review software](https://devguide.ropensci.org/)

## Two crucial components

"[Helping to improve software] in a kind and respectful way is just as important as the technical aspect". 

-- Yanina Bellini Saibene

## The way we communicate | Be kind and respectful

* "It's like when I hold the door open for someone."
* "Even when someone volunteers their time, there is a cost of their time and effort."
